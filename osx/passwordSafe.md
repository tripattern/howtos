I have Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9.1).
In case this could help others, the downloaded app won't run/open (error message says something about file being damaged and to remove it to Trash).
I needed to do:
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Click the lock to make changes > select "Anywhere" for Allow apps downloaded from
After the app opened, I changed setting back to "Mac App Store and identified developers" and click the lock icon to lock again.
