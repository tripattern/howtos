## Setup
### Mac OS X
```
$ brew cask install mactex texmaker
# OR if you want latex slimmed down...
$ brew cask install basictex
$ brew install pandoc
```
* Note if pandoc can't find pdflatex or other latex packages after installing mactex
  * Then try open a new terminal to re-init the path
  * Or start the tex utility in applications and go into a new terminal
