## Usage
```
docker-compose up -d # kills everything and restarts dokcer and reads docker compose file and starts fresh containers i.e. no old state

docker-compose start # uses old state
docker-compose stop # doesn't delete state

docker compose down # nukes old container and state

docker-compose logs -f <name of service e.g. oracle NOT CONTAINER NAME (hint: use tab)>

docker-compose ps
```
